Home screen
The key points offered with the circular designs are clear and eye catching, but the second image having a square component 
inside a circular display feels a bit clashing, perhaps a different way of displaying the information inside the circle, 
or a different visual design altogether that doesnt use circles would be better for this use case.
The caroussel looks and feels great, specially the fade in animations for text, tho the transition arrows i notice disappear
when the window gets narrower, even tho there was still space for them, perhaphs the style on them could be made in a way where
window size is better taken into account.
The navigation menu would be better if it was sticky, and stayed at the top as you scroll, so the user doesn't have to scroll
all the way back up to navigate on the app.

Sign Up
In the log in sccreen, the first name and last name inputs should be visually separated, since if they are merged as they
are now an user would thing its the same field  and enter their first and last name in the first name field, and then have to
go back and correct his when trying to sign up, this could be avoided then by separating them.
The fields could dynamically check if they are correctly filled in, instead of checking at the moment of pressing sign up
this makes it easier on the user to correct their mistakes as they will be inmediatly shown if their text is valid, instead of
having to try to sign up and be denied every time they make a mistake.
The password warning could also dynamically check the password instead of having to wait for the field to lose focus, a throtle
on the typing would make the field only be checked once the user hasnt typed for a second and thus not be annoyingly correcting
the user when they havent finished writing their password.

Sign In
the keep me logged in is more traditionally expected to be below the field it pertains to or at the bottom of the form
The reddening of the fields when incorrect is visually clear, but a message explaining the exact error to the user will
cause less frustration for users who don't understand what the issue is, i tried signin in with an invalid email format and
there was no message, just a red error, as a user i dont have a way of knowing if the error is caused by the incorrect format
or if it's caused because my email is wrong or there isnt an account with that email.
